## `cartDetails`

Cart details is an object with skus of the items in the cart as keys and details of the items as the value, for example:

import CartDisplayWrapper from 'components/cart-display-wrapper'
import API from 'components/api'

<CartDisplayWrapper />

As you add more items to the cartItem array, cart details will update with quantity and total amount of
that particular item.

<br />

## `cartCount`

Total number of items in the cart

<br />

## `totalPrice`

Total price of all products in cart

<API />

## `handleCartClick`, `handleCloseCart` and `shouldDisplayCart`

These three API items provide basic state management for your cart. The cart state is stored in the `shouldDisplayCart` variable. The two functions can be used to update this state.

`shouldDisplayCart`: Boolean value which can be used to handle the cart's displayed or undisplayed state.

`handleCartClick`: Function which toggles the displayed state for the cart between true and false, updates `shouldDisplayCart`.

`handleCloseCart`: Function which sets the displayed cart state to false, updates `shouldDisplayCart`.
